# Pentesting packages for Arch
This script automates the installation process of some pentesting tools I need from the BlackArch repository on Arch Linux. It starts by updating the system and then adds the BlackArch repository key.

Next, it enables the BlackArch repository by appending the repository information to the /etc/pacman.conf file. After updating the package list, the script installs the pentesting tools using the BlackArch repository.
